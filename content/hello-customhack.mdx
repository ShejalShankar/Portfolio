# Building a Portfolio You Can Talk To

I wanted my portfolio to be different. Not just another static site with sections to scroll through, but something that feels alive and conversational. So I built [heyavi.me](https://heyavi.me) - a portfolio that literally talks back to you.

Instead of traditional navigation, visitors can click the mic button and have a natural conversation. Ask about my projects, experience, or even paste a job link - and the AI responds with both voice and dynamically generated UI components.

## What It Does

The portfolio works as a traditional site if you prefer scrolling, but the magic happens when you interact with the AI assistant:

- **Voice Conversations**: Click the mic and speak naturally - "What projects have you built?" or "Tell me about your work at tambo"
- **Dynamic UI Generation**: The AI doesn't just talk - it shows relevant components like photo grids, project cards, or my resume
- **Job Analysis**: Paste any job posting URL and get an instant analysis showing how I match the requirements
- **Smart Context**: The AI adapts its responses based on who you are - student, recruiter, or fellow developer

## The Technical Implementation

### Core Stack

- **Framework**: Next.js 15 with App Router for optimal performance
- **AI Integration**: [Tambo AI](https://tambo.co) for the conversational layer
- **Voice**: OpenAI Whisper for speech-to-text, ElevenLabs for text-to-speech
- **Database**: PostgreSQL for blog comments, guestbook, and analytics
- **Auth**: NextAuth.js with GitHub OAuth
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom glassmorphic effects
- **Crawling**: [Firecrawl](https://firecrawl.dev) for efficiently crawling links pasted into the chat

### Voice Processing Pipeline

The voice interaction flow is surprisingly complex:

1. **Voice Activity Detection**: Real-time audio analysis to detect when you start/stop speaking
2. **Smart Silence Detection**: Waits for natural pauses before processing (1 second threshold)
3. **Audio Conversion**: WebM to WAV format for Whisper API compatibility
4. **Submission Detection**: Uses GPT-4 to determine if the transcript is complete
5. **Global Audio Management**: Centralized system to handle TTS playback and prevent overlaps

### Dynamic Component System

The AI can render 10+ different components based on context:

- **PhotoGridSection** - Shows my photos with captions
- **ProjectsSection** - Displays projects with descriptions
- **ResumeOverview** - Professional background + resume button
- **JobAnalysisCard** - Visualizes job matching results
- **GuestbookDisplay** - Shows visitor messages
- **SocialMediaGrid** - Contact links in a grid layout

### The "Hire Me" Intelligence

When someone shares a job posting URL:

1. [Firecrawl](https://firecrawl.dev) extracts the job content
2. AI analyzes requirements vs. my experience
3. Generates a match score and talking points
4. Shows a "JobAnalysisCard" with visual breakdown
5. Provides a conversational, tailored pitch

## Design Decisions

### Minimal UI, Maximum Impact

- **Floating Mic Button**: Always accessible, with visual feedback for recording/speaking states
- **Glassmorphic Panels**: Semi-transparent overlays that don't obstruct content
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Start with just a mic, expand to show conversation history
- **Keyboard Shortcuts**: âŒ˜+K for power users

### Voice-First, But Not Voice-Only

The site remains fully functional without voice:

- Traditional navigation in the header
- All content accessible via scrolling
- Text input option in the chat interface
- Fallbacks for unsupported browsers

## Challenges & Solutions

**Audio Feedback Loops**: Solved with a global audio manager that tracks all playing audio and stops previous TTS when new messages arrive.

**Mobile Voice Input**: Browser limitations required careful handling of permissions and fallback options.

**Component Generation Timing**: The AI needed careful prompting to generate components at the right moments, not too eagerly.

## What's Next

I'm continuing to refine the experience:

- More sophisticated job matching algorithms
- Multi-language support for global opportunities
- Voice personality customization
- Integration with more portfolio platforms

## Try It Yourself

Visit [heyavi.me](https://heyavi.me) and click the mic button. Ask me anything - about my projects, experience, or paste a job link to see the analysis in action.

The entire project is [open source on GitHub](https://github.com/akhileshrangani4/heyavi.me). Feel free to fork it and build your own talking portfolio!

## Key Takeaways

Building this taught me that AI can enhance personal websites without making them feel robotic. The key is maintaining authenticity while adding genuinely useful interactions. A portfolio should tell your story - mine just happens to tell it out loud.
