Hello, World! While writing this, I feel overwhelemed by the work that I am doing, I have a lot on my plate, a lot to do and yet a small amount of time!

We all feel like this is not enough, this is not for us, but guess what? you are EXACTLY where you belong, and that is where I  belong too. I am not a perfect person, I am not a perfect student, I am not a perfect writer, I am not a perfect anything, but I am a person who is trying to be better, and that is what matters. I am trying to be better, I am trying to be a better person, a better student, a better writer, a better anything. 

so, while keeping that in mind, I push myself to become a better person, every single day.

From now on, I am going to write anything new that I learn, anything new that I come across and feel like sharing with the world.

SEE YOU IN ANOTHER BLOG!
